## Evaluation of Dissolution Kinetics

Consider the growth rate as 

$G(l) = k (C - C_s)$

At initial time:

$G_i = k (-C_s)$

Considering $C_s$ as 0.323

```{.python .run}
C_s = 0.323
print('Growth initial is = {}'.format(1e-2*(-C_s)))
```

Because of that, we should take very care with this approach!

```{.python .run format="text"}
print('This is a print with equation $E = m c^2$')
```
